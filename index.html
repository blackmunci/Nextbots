        <h3>1.Angry Munci</h3>
        <p>Angry Munci takes the appearance of the silhouette of a monkey with a bit of hair. Her only facial features are a hyper-realistic pair of eyes glaring down at the screen. She also has deformed outlines around her eyes, supposedly eyelids. The eyes were darkened like the original source in the outbreak update on May 19th, 2023. Before that, her eyes were brightened. However, in the Birthday update they were brightened once again.
        If you look closely at her eyes, you can see the faint green and pink artifacts, which were most likely compressed.(angry munci speed is 840)

    
        <h3>2.Happy</h3>
        <p><br>Happy appears to be a smiling grey red face with large plain, white teeth and complicated big eyes. It doesn't have skin, displaying dark flesh obscuring its face. What seems to be a little static on the image, and it's eyes are surrounded with thick white outlines that were half-closed. Ears aren't visible, nor have any nose. The edges around its face are wrinkly because it was poorly edited.There were faint black outlines if you examine the image closer. Highlight within each pupil was below the lower eyelid.(happy speed is 750) </p>

    
        <h3>3.Trauma</h3>
        <br>Trauma features a disfigured, red face with transparent holes blotting its upper head alongside a lack of skin, with its mouth twisted into a smile. It emits red light in dark areas. If you look closely at the image, you can tell there are faint red edges around it.(Trauma speed is 550)

    
        <h3>4.Qubert</h3>
        <br>Qubert appears to be a badly drawn snail, with light green skin, a smiley face with small dotted eyes and eyebrows, and yellow, pink, and black operculums.(qubert speed is 270)
    
        <h3>5.Super sanic</h3>
        <br>Super sanic appears to be the same as its regular counter part. However, the super form of sanic is glowing, has red pupils and is yellow. He was drawn in MS Paint.(super sanic speed is 200)

    
        <h3>6.Sanic(normal)</h3>
        <br>Sanic is depicted to have red shoes which point out the opposite direction from each other, and white gloves that make up his design. sanic's spikes also were, and the fill tool was clearly used with a terrible fashion, likely drawn in Microsoft Paint.(Sanic speed is 180)

    
        <h3>7.Yippee</h3>
        <br>Yippee appears to be a quadruped creature with a large head, blank expression, stubby limbs and large black reflective eyes in monochromatic color. The GIF gives a confetti explosion whenever it speaks. yippee also appears to be drawn in Microsoft Paint, in a similar manner to sanic, tiler, and qubert. The in-game image appears to be blurred with white edges around it.(yippee speed is 100)

    
        <h3>8.Speed</h3>
        <br>Speed has swarthy brown skin, black braided hair, dark brown eyes, and wears a black shirt with long sleeves. Behind him in the background is what appears to be a tree with pink flowers on it.(Speed speed is 70-80)
